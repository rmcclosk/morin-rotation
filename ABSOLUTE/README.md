ABSOLUTE
========

This folder contains all scripts necessary for running ABSOLUTE. The first step
is to run ABSOLUTE.R on segments from each sample individually. The second step
is to run summarize.R on all the results at once.

This folder is set up with a Makefile. To use it, put your segments in the
"segments" folder. If you have MAF files, put them in the "mafs" folder. Then
make.
